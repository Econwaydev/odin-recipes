    <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
    <p>
        A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy; this lasagna made
        with spinach pasta cannot be beat. It's excellent if you want to 
        impress some guests, or even yourself. 
        It may be a bit time consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you 
        put into it.

    <h3><b>Directions</b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4><b>Step 1</b></h4>
            <p>
                For the pasta dough: Steam the spinach in a steamer or over boiling
                water until bright green, 2 minutes. Squeeze to remove excess moisture 
                and process in a food processor to make a paste. Combine spinach with 
                eggs, semolina, and salt and process until smooth. Stir in enough of 
                the flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, cover and set aside.
            </p>
        </li>

            <h4><b>Step 2</b></h4>
            <p>
                For the ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. 
                Saute bacon, carrot, celery and onion until onion is translucent. Stir 
                in ground pork, ground beef and minced ham, and cook until browned. 
                Stir in tomato paste, oregano and beef stock. (Reserve the chicken 
                livers for later.) Season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, 
                cover and simmer 20 minutes.
            </p>
